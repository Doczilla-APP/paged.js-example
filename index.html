<!-- 3.1 Section 1 - Foreword -->
<h2 class="no-break">Foreword</h2>

<p>HTML and CSS are beautiful languages and one of the landmark achievements of collaboration and the open web. Together, they allow you to create beautifully typeset digital content that can be viewed on any device, without any special software or paid licenses.</p>

<p>The web however was developed for scrolling content, and not paged media (by which we mean discrete pages, like in print or pdf). Paged media, especially pdfs, remains an important medium of communication. There is something about having discrete pages, a feeling of stability and comfort that comes from a consistent layout (typically A4 or US Letter), reducing the cognitive tax when consuming new content.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, whilst there are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-page-3/">W3C standards</a> on paged media, adoption by browsers has not been adequate to date. High quality paid alternatives exist in <a href="https://www.princexml.com">PrinceXML</a>, but a native, free solution has been missing.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26578826">happenstance discussion</a> on HackerNews brought my attention to <a href="https://www.pagedjs.org">paged.js</a>, a genius idea to polyfill the required capabilities to allow browsers to natively handle paged media, without having to build the whole rendering engine from scratch.</p>

<p>This guide provides a basic tutorial to using paged.js, for my own future reference and yours, and I highly recommend you visiting their site and supporting their project. In particular, their <a href="https://www.pagedjs.org/documentation/05-designing-for-print/">documentation</a> covers many aspects of advanced paged media and is a worthwhile next step after reading this guide.</p>

<!-- 3.2 Section 2 - Getting Started -->
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>There are three elements to producing PDFs from HTML through paged.js. First, you will need to load the <a href="https://www.pagedjs.org/documentation/releases/">paged.polyfill.js</a> library either by hosting locally or linking to it directly:</p>

<code><pre>
&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/pagedjs/dist/paged.polyfill.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre></code>

<p>Second, you will need to have a web server as paged.js works by modifying your underlying HTML and CSS. One way is to host statically on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> (or similar), another is use a local server like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb">Web Server for Chrome</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to have your own custom stylesheet where you will enter all the formatting rules to apply. In our example repo, these rules are contained within <a href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna/pdf/blob/main/style.css">style.css.</a></p>


<h3>Alternate (easier) Installation</h3>
<p>As an easier alternative, simply clone my <a href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna/pdf">example repo</a> (and set up GitHub Pages for the cloned repo) and then read through style.css and index.html to understand how it works. The rest of this guide takes you through the code example in my repo.</p>

<h3>Media Queries</h3>

<p>Before we begin with the main guide, I want to quickly introduce you to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">media queries</a>. Media queries allow us to modify the stylesheet associated with our website depending on whether it is viewed on screen or for print (e.g. when printing to pdf or paper)  and allow us to set different style sheets for print, screen and mobile.</p>

<p>A common use case for media queries is to hide navigational menus from a print or mobile view. Say we have defined a class "sidebar", we could hide it from a print view, whilst keeping it visible in the primary screen view, as follows.</p>

<code><pre>
@media print {
    .sidebar {
        display: none;
    }
}
</pre></code>

<p>Whilst we will not make use of media queries for the rest of this guide and in the example repo, please do remember them and use them liberally to create distinct views for screen, print and mobile based on your requirements. They are a central component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive web design</a>, a topic we could dedicate an entire book to, but not one for today.</p>



<h2>Basic Features</h2>


<h3>Page Size</h3>
<p>Most properties will be captured in CSS as an attribute to the <mark>@page</mark> rule. For example, we can set the page size to A4 with the following. Other valid page sizes include letter, legal, ledged, A0 to A7, A10, B4 and B5.</p>

<code><pre>
@page { size: A4; }
</pre></code>

<p>Portrait is the default orientation, but you print in landscape by using the following variation. Finally, you can custom page sizes as the second example below shows. This would be useful if you wanted to create PowerPoint widescreen format slides for example (190.5mm x 338.67mm).</p>

<code><pre>
@page { size: A4 landscape; }
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
@page { size: 140mm 200mm; }
</pre></code>


<h3>Page Breaks</h3>
<p>By default, paged.js will determine how much content fills up a page and then insert page breaks at the overflow points. We can manually insert page breaks by creating a <mark>page-break</mark> class and setting its <mark>break-after</mark> property to <mark>page</mark>.</p>

<code><pre>
.page-break { break-after: page; }
</pre></code>

<p>We then simply have to add an empty page-break div in HTML at the points we want a page break:</p>

<code><pre>
&lt;div class="page-break"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></code>


<h3>Page Numbers</h3>
<p>We can use CSS counters to add page numbers. The below CSS will add a page number to the bottom right of every page.</p>

<code><pre>
@page {
  	@bottom-right { content: counter(page); }
}
</pre></code>


<h3>Basic Headers & Footers</h3>
<p>The preceding page number example gives us a sneak peek into how we could add headers and footers. We can add these in six locations - top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center and of course bottom-right as before. Below are some basic examples of simple headers & footers, with the second example showing how we can increase the width in case we need to.</p>

<code><pre>
@page {

	@top-right {
		content: "Confidential"
	}

  	@bottom-left {
  		content: "Beautiful PDFs from HTML";
     	width: 40mm
    }
}
</pre></code>

<h2>Advanced Features</h2>

<h3>Automatic Counters</h3>
<p>One useful feature is to automatically number sections, subsections and figures. We can achieve this with plain CSS. First, let's define the class <mark>no-counter</mark> as a general class to exclude a section or figure from the numbering. Subsequently we can generate the counters as follows, noting that the subsection and figure counters reset at every new instance of a section.</p>

<code><pre>
body {
	counter-reset: sectionNumber;
	counter-reset: subsectionNumber;
	counter-reset: figureNumber;
}

h2:not(.no-counter) {
	counter-increment: sectionNumber;
}

h2 {
	counter-reset: subsectionNumber;
}

h3:not(.no-counter) {
	counter-increment: subsectionNumber;
	counter-reset: figureNumber;
}

h3 {
	counter-reset: figureNumber;
}

figure:not(.no-counter) {
	counter-increment: figureNumber;
}
</pre></code>

<p>We then take this one step further and use CSS to automatically generate text labels to reflect the counter numbers within our sections and figures.</p>

<figure>
<figcaption>Code to Auto-Generate Numbering Labels</figcaption>
<code><pre>
h2:not(.no-counter):before {
	content: counter(sectionNumber) ". ";
}

h3:not(.no-counter)::before {
	content: counter(sectionNumber) "." counter(subsectionNumber) " ";
}

figcaption:not(.no-counter)::before {
	content: "Fig. " counter(sectionNumber) "." counter(subsectionNumber) "." counter(figureNumber) " ";
}
</pre></code>
</figure>

<h3>Advanced Headers & Foooters</h3>
<p>We can generate formatted headers</p>


<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
